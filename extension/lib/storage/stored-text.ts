/**
 * The single rule for user-entered text that Stepmark persists and archives.
 *
 * Storage normalizes with it, the editor normalizes as the user types (so the
 * value it compares against is exactly what storage keeps), and the portable
 * archive validates with it. One rule means anything storage accepts can always
 * be exported and backed up, and an archive Stepmark wrote can always be read.
 *
 * Multi-line text (step descriptions, project titles and descriptions) keeps
 * tab, line feed and carriage return; every other C0 control, DEL and every C1
 * control (U+0080–U+009F, e.g. U+0085 NEXT LINE) is removed. Single-line labels
 * (tags, section titles) drop all of them, including tab and newlines.

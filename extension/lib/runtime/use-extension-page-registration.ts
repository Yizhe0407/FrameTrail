/**
 * Announces which extension page this tab shows, so every later "open the
 * editor / open the library" request reuses it instead of spawning another
 * tab. lib/recording/background/extension-page-tabs.ts explains why the
 * background cannot discover its own pages without this. Every page
 * registers: pages navigate their tab between one another, and each
 * registration replaces whatever the tab was remembered as before.
 *
 * Re-announced whenever the window regains focus — if several copies of a
 * page are open, the one the user last looked at is the one that gets
 * reused — and when the page is restored from the back/forward cache, which
 * re-shows it without mounting it again.

/**
 * Decides, per trusted press, whether a step-mode gesture is a click (record a
 * step, replay the activation after the screenshot) or something else — a
 * drag, a text selection, a slider move, a double click's second press — that
 * must reach the page natively and never become a step.
 *
 * The press is never `preventDefault()`ed. The page's own listeners are kept
 * from seeing it (`stopImmediatePropagation()` in the capture phase), so a
 * mousedown-driven menu cannot open before the screenshot, while the
 * browser's default actions run untouched: the caret lands where the user
 * clicked, a text selection or native drag can start, a range thumb grabs.
 *
 * - Released without travelling → `click`. The trusted `click` event is
 *   cancelled (its activation — navigation, toggling, submission — is what
 *   must wait for the screenshot) and replayed by the recorder afterwards.
 * - Travelled past the drag threshold, or the browser started a native drag
 *   → `drag`; a pointercancel → `cancel`. The page is handed the withheld
 *   press as a synthetic pointerdown/mousedown and every later event of the
 *   gesture passes through, so script-driven drags start as well.
 * - A press the browser itself counts as the 2nd/3rd click on the same
 *   element (its mousedown `detail` ≥ 2) continues a double/triple click: it
 *   is folded into the previous step (`merged`) instead of becoming its own,
 *   and its clicks plus the dblclick are replayed in order after that step's
 *   screenshot — or pass through natively if that click was already replayed.
 *   The browser's click count is the only judge: two separate clicks are
 *   always two steps, however close together they land.
